        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this project, we delve into a comparison of business fundamentals across  leading companies in the technology and healthcare sectors of the S&P 500. The core of our investigation focuses on fundamental analysis—evaluating the financial health, competitive positioning, and potential for future shareholder returns to gauge a company's intrinsic value.

            Fundamental ratios and indicators are important in assessing whether a stock is trading above or below its true value. We aim to bring these financial metrics to life through our visualizations to assess what drives stock prices and how financials of healthcare and tech industries inform prevailing business models.  While these visualizations won’t lead to concrete investment decisions, they can be used as a starting point to base investing frameworks off of.
            
            Our visualizations will navigate through the volatility and steadiness of market trends to provide a deeper understanding of the disparities in business fundamentals between tech and healthcare entities and the various factors influencing stock prices over time. Through our findings, we hope to offer insights into the relationship between a company's fundamental soundness and its perceived value in the marketplace. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>This boxplot illustrates a comparison between the healthcare and tech industries. It is observed that tech stocks exhibit a greater variability in debt levels, as indicated by the wider spread of data points. This contrasts with the healthcare sector, which shows a more compact interquartile range, suggesting less variance among companies.  Healthcare stocks, it appears, can sustain higher debt loads relative to equity, likely due to the constant demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals, which in turn allows for more predictable cash flows. This predictability is beneficial for managing and paying down debt. The outliers in the tech sector suggest that while most tech companies maintain a certain range of debt-to-equity ratio, some significantly deviate from the norm.</p>
