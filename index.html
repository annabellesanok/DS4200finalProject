      <h1>Visualizing Fundamental and Stock Data of S&P 500 Companies</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we delve into a comparison of business fundamentals
        across leading companies in the technology and healthcare sectors of the
        S&P 500. The core of our investigation focuses on fundamental
        analysis—evaluating the financial health, competitive positioning, and
        potential for future shareholder returns to gauge a company's intrinsic
        value. Fundamental ratios and indicators are important in assessing
        whether a stock is trading above or below its true value. We aim to
        bring these financial metrics to life through our visualizations to
        assess what drives stock prices and how financials of healthcare and
        tech industries inform prevailing business models.  While these
        visualizations won’t lead to concrete investment decisions, they can be
        used as a starting point to base investing frameworks off of. Our
        visualizations will navigate through the volatility and steadiness of
        market trends to provide a deeper understanding of the disparities in
        business fundamentals between tech and healthcare entities and the
        various factors influencing stock prices over time. Through our
        findings, we hope to offer insights into the relationship between a
        company's fundamental soundness and its perceived value in the
        marketplace.

        Our project explores fundamental financial data for selected healthcare
        and technology stocks within the S&P 500, spanning from 2009 to 2023.
        Our dataset offers an extensive range of metrics, including closing
        price, volume, net earnings per share (EPS), sales per share, and
        price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, across 33 different financial indicators.
        Each stock's data points, recorded approximately five times per month,
        result in approximately 2,500 rows per stock. <br />
        <br />

        Our data includes prominent companies in the healthcare sector such as
        AbbVie (ABBV), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), AstraZeneca (AZN),
        Bristol-Myers (BMY), Danaher (DHR), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly
        (LLY), Merck (MRK), and Pfizer (PFE). The technology segment is
        represented by tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Cisco
        Systems (CSCO), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and
        Oracle (ORCL). <br />
        <br />

        Initially, we ingested data from multiple CSV files into individual
        dataframes, while also appending a new column labeled 'Industry' to
        categorize each entry into Healthcare and Tech. Then we grouped each
        financial metric by quarter to average the values. Finally, we merged
        these dataframes into a single comprehensive dataframe, which we used to
        create our visualizations. <br />
        <br />

        The visualization above showcases the trajectory of closing prices over
        time for each ticker within each industry. It reveals the growth
        patterns and trends of individual companies, and also provides a
        comparative insight into the industry’s dynamics over the years. Through
        our line chart, it becomes evident that while some stocks have shown
        consistent upward momentum, others display more volatile trajectories.
        The distinct color coding for each ticker allows for clearer comparison
        across the different companies, and the interactive dropdown allows the
        user to toggle between industries. The closing prices of healthcare
        companies, as shown in the visualization, depict the impact of market
        conditions, company performance, and sector-specific events on stock
        valuations over the period.

      <h2>Static Data Visualizations</h2>

      <div id="static1-container">
        <h3>Boxplot</h3>
        <iframe
          src="boxplot.html"
          style="width: 400px; height: 325px"
          frameborder="0"
          title="Boxplot"
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          This boxplot provides a comparative analysis of debt-to-equity ratios
          across each of the industries. This metric is useful in understanding
          how companies leverage debt relative to their equity, which is a key
          indicator of their financial health and risk management strategy.<br /><br />

          In the healthcare industry, companies typically operate with
          consistent and predictable cash flows due to the constant demand for
          healthcare services and pharmaceutical products. This sector's boxplot
          showcases a more compact IQR, indicative of less variance in how these
          companies manage their debt levels. The stability of cash flows in
          this sector allows for healthcare companies to sustain higher debt
          loads. This provides them with a strategic advantage as it can be used
          to fund ongoing research, expansion, and operations without
          jeopardizing financial stability.<br /><br />

          The tech industry exhibits a broader range of debt-to-equity ratios,
          as reflected by a wider spread of data points in the boxplot. This
          diversity is indicative of the varied business models and stages of
          growth within the tech sector. While a number of tech companies
          maintain moderate leverage, demonstrating a cautious approach to debt,
          there are outliers that deviate significantly from the norm. These
          outliers could represent aggressive growth strategies through debt
          financing or could signal companies encountering financial
          challenges.<br /><br />

          The whiskers of the boxplot extend to capture the full range of
          values, but there are several outliers to note. In the case of tech
          companies, these outliers could be younger, high-growth companies
          investing heavily in innovation, or established firms diversifying
          through acquisitions — both scenarios where debt might temporarily
          outpace equity.

        <h3>Current Asset & Liability Across Industries</h3>
        <iframe
          src="lineOfBestFitChart.html"
          style="width: 1000px; height: 510px"
          frameborder="0"
          title="Interactive Line Chart"
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          This visualization shows three different key values: current asset,
          current libaility, and working capital across the two selected
          industries, tech and healthcare. Between the three values, current
          assets represent the resources a company can use to fund its
          operations, current liabilities represent a company's short-term
          financial obligations that needs to be paid off from the current
          assets, and working capital, which is current assets minus current
          liabilities, represents how much liquid assets a company has after
          paying off its short-term debts. <br />
          <br />

          Between the three recorded values, we're most interested in comparing
          working capital between the two industries. Working capital is an
          important measure of a company's liquidity, operational efficiency,
          and short-term financial health. Companies with high working capital
          can better manage their cash flows, take advantage of opportunities,
          and withstand financial hardships in the short run. A positive working
          capital means the company has enough current assets to cover its
          current liabilities and continue operations. A negative working
          capital indicates the company may struggle to pay off its short-term
          obligations with its existing current assets. <br />
          <br />

          When comparing the working capital of tech and healthcare companies,
          we noticed that healthcare companies tend to have a lower working
          capital than those of tech companies. We suspect that this is so
          because healthcare, as an industry, is much more mature than tech, and
          therefore are able to take on more short-term debts (hence the higher
          current liabilities as well). Another interesting aspect of our data
          is that although tech has higher overall working capital, the downward
          trending line of best fit shows that the industry is slowly
          maturing/stablizing. Perhaps the delayed growth of the industry's
          current assets will have an latened affect on the current liabilities.

      <div id="bubblechart">
        <h3>PE vs. PFCF Ratios</h3>
        <p>
          This bubble chart was created using D3. Rather than comparing each of
          the industries as a whole, we decided to look into a few of the ratios
          within just tech companies to understand how they compare to one
          another. <br /><br />

          The horizontal axis represents the PE (price to earnings) ratio, which
          measures a company's current share price relative to its per-share
          earnings. A higher PE ratio may suggest that a company's stock is
          overvalued, or investors are expecting high growth rates in the
          future. The vertical axis shows the PFCF (price to free cash flow)
          ratio, indicating how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of
          free cash flow. Lower values typically signify better value. Each
          bubble's size reflects the company's ROE (return on equity), which
          measures how much profit a company generates with the money
          shareholders have invested. Larger bubbles denote higher ROE,
          suggesting more efficient use of equity. <br /><br />

          NVDA (Nvidia) demonstrates a high PE ratio and a moderate PFCF ratio
          with a high ROE value. Nvidia’s high PE can be attributed to the
          market’s high expectations for growth, especially given its dominant
          position in the GPU market and its prospects in AI and deep learning
          industries. Its high ROE is indicative of effective management, which
          can justify the higher PE ratio. <br /><br />

          A company like CSCO (Cisco Systems) shows moderate PE and lower PFCF
          ratios with moderate ROE bubble size. It is a mature technology
          company with a steady cash flow, so its valuation may not be as high
          as more growth-oriented tech firms.

        <h3>PE vs. EPS</h3>
        <iframe

        <p>
          This visualization reconciles investors’ expectations
          (price-to-earnings) with reality (earnings per share). In this case,
          the price-to-earnings ratio is supposed to gauge what investors think
          a stock/company will earn in the future, while the earnings-per-share
          is how much a company earned over the last year. <br />
          <br />

          Increases in a stock’s PE ratio means that investors expect this
          company to do better in the future, while decreases in PE ratio
          reflects souring sentiment over a company’s prospects. A lot of the
          time, it can be observed that as a company’s EPS increased, PE
          increased as well, which shows that as a company earns more, investors
          update their beliefs about a company to reflect that its profitability
          is growing and will likely continue to grow in the future. <br />
          <br />

          However, the observed relationship is not always the case. There are
          many instances throughout the graphs where sharp increases or
          decreases in EPS seemed to have the opposite effect on PE. This is
          because investors are forward looking. Investors are able to parse
          when sharp increases or decreases in earnings are essentially one-time
          events. A one-time increase in EPS, for example, does not necessarily
          mean that this is the level of earnings that should be expected of the
          company in the future. EPS is not a perfect metric of pure,
          “steady-state” operating profitability, as it can be impacted by
          one-time tax breaks or interest payments. <br />
          <br />

          Overall, the relationship between PE and EPS is not straight-forward.
          Investors are forward looking, while PE and EPS ratios can only be
          captured after-the-fact (after investors have already updated their
          beliefs about a company and after a company releases its earnings).
          However, our graphs show that the two figures are at least somewhat
          correlated over a long-time horizon (10+ years), which captures the
          essence of investing (I.E. investors pay a premium (price) for a
          company’s current earnings in order to receive a greater return on
          their investment in the future through increased earnings).

          What moves a stock? <br />
          <br />
          This visualization shows how stock prices respond to changes in a
          company’s profitability as measured by gross profit (profit after
          taking into account cost of making and delivering goods/services) and
          operating profit (profit after taking into account ALL expenses like
          rent and administrative expenses, but before tax or interest
          payments). As is expected, stock prices tended to rise as
          profitability rose. However, what was interesting to us is that the
          degree to which this happened varied between the healthcare and tech
          industries. <br />
          <br />

          Technology stocks like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO),
          Alphabet (GOOGL), etc. demonstrate consistent increases in stock price
          as profitability increased. On the other hand, this was not always the
          case for healthcare stocks, where stock prices for many companies such
          as Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) and Eli Lilly (LLY) among others managed
          to rise even without drastically different profitability profiles.
          <br />
          <br />

          We suspect this trend is because technology companies are much
          younger, and so investors are looking for profitability to prove that
          these companies’ business models are viable. In this case, achieving
          and expanding profitability is the primary way that these companies
          communicate to the market that they are worthy of long-term
          investments. It was almost always the case that as profitability rose,
          the prices of tech stocks rose in tandem. <br />
          <br />

          On the other hand, big healthcare companies tend to be much more
          mature, having been around for longer than their technology
          counterparts. A lot of them have already achieved healthy levels of
          profitability. For them, showing investors that they are worth
          investing in is mostly a matter of improving the pipeline of drugs
          they are developing or returning cash (profits) to shareholders
          through dividends or stock repurchase programs. The former can
          influence profitability but more importantly is an assurance that
          revenue can continue to grow or remain stable, while the latter is a
          matter of good corporate governance from the management of these

      <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
      <p>
        From our data visualizations, we've gained crucial insights into the
        financial landscapes of leading tech and healthcare companies in the S&P
        500. Firstly, our analysis of debt-to-equity ratios showcased distinct
        financial strategies: healthcare firms tend to maintain stable debt
        levels due to predictable cash flows, while tech companies exhibit a
        wider range of ratios reflecting diverse growth stages and business
        models. Secondly, comparisons of liquidity metrics revealed that tech
        companies generally have higher working capital, indicating better
        short-term financial health and operational efficiency, whereas
        healthcare companies may rely more on debt financing strategies. <br />
        <br />

        Investor sentiment and market dynamics were elucidated through
        interactive visualizations. For instance, our PE vs. EPS analysis
        highlighted how market expectations influence stock valuations, with
        investors reacting to both current earnings and future growth potential.
        Moreover, our exploration of stock price movements in response to
        changes in profitability underscored industry-specific dynamics, with
        tech stocks showing stronger correlations between profitability
        increases and stock price rises compared to mature healthcare companies. <br />
        <br />

        Looking ahead, this project could expand to include a broader range of
        industries for comparative analysis, incorporate predictive modeling for
        stock price forecasting, develop risk assessment frameworks using
        financial ratios, delve deeper into sector-specific insights, and build
        interactive decision support tools for investors. These avenues offer
        promising directions for leveraging data visualization to enhance
        investment decision-making processes and gain actionable insights into
        market trends and financial fundamentals.
