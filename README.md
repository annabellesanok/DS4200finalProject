In this project, I created a website using HTML and CSS. On the website, there are interactive visualizations of financial ratios. Our primary goal was to compare business fundamentals
between companies in the healthcare and tech industries. The visualizations were created in a Python Jupyter notebook using Pandas for data processing and Altair for data visualization.

The site is hosted on GitHub pages and can be accessed at the link below.
